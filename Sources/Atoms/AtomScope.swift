import SwiftUI

/// A view to override or monitor atoms in scope.
///
/// This view allows you to monitor changes of atoms used in descendant views by``AtomScope/observe(_:)``.
///
/// ```swift
/// AtomScope {
///     MyView()
/// }
/// .observe { snapshot in
///     if let count = snapshot.lookup(CounterAtom()) {
///         print(count)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It inherits from the atom store provided by ``AtomRoot`` through environment values by default,
/// but sometimes SwiftUI can fail to pass environment values in the view-tree for some reason.
/// The typical example is that, in case you use SwiftUI view inside UIKit view, it could fail as
/// SwiftUI can't pass environment values to UIKit across boundaries.
/// In that case, you can wrap the view with ``AtomScope`` and pass a view context to it so that
/// the descendant views can explicitly inherit the store.
///
/// ```swift
/// @ViewContext
/// var context
///
/// var body: some View {
///     MyUIViewWrappingView {
///         AtomScope(context) {
///             MySwiftUIView()
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Additionally, if for some reason your app cannot use ``AtomRoot`` to manage the store,
/// you can instead manage the store on your own and pass the instance to ``AtomScope``
/// to allow descendant views to use atoms.
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = AtomStore()
/// let rootView = AtomScope(store) {
///     RootView()
/// }
/// let window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
/// window.rootViewController = UIHostingController(rootView: rootView)
/// window.makeKeyAndVisible()
/// ```
