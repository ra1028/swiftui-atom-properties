import SwiftUI

/// A property wrapper type that can watch and read-write access to the given atom conforms
/// to ``StateAtom``.
///
/// It starts watching the atom when the view accesses the ``wrappedValue``, and when the atom changes,
/// the view invalidates its appearance and recomputes the body. However, if only write access is
/// performed, it doesn't start watching.
///
/// See also ``Watch`` to have read-only access and ``WatchStateObject`` to receive updates of
/// ``ObservableObjectAtom``.
/// The interface of this property wrapper follows `@State`.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// struct CounterView: View {
///     @WatchState(CounterAtom())
///     var count
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Text("Count: \(count)")    // Read value, and start watching.
///             Stepper(value: $count) {}  // Use as a binding
///             Button("+100") {
///                 count += 100           // Mutation which means simultaneous read-write access.
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
