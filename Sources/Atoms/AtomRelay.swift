import SwiftUI

/// A view that relays an internal store from the passed view context or from environment values.
///
/// For some reasons, sometimes SwiftUI can fail to pass environment values in the view-tree.
/// The typical example is that, if you use SwiftUI view inside UIKit view, it could fail as
/// SwiftUI can't pass environment values across UIKit.
/// In that case, you can wrap the view with ``AtomRelay`` and pass a view context to it so that
/// the descendant views can explicitly inherit an internal store.
///
/// ```swift
/// @ViewContext
/// var context
///
/// var body: some View {
///     MyUIViewWrappingView {
///         AtomRelay(context) {
///             MySwiftUIView()
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Also, ``AtomRelay`` can be created without passing a view context, and in this case, it relays
/// an internal store from environment values.
/// Relaying from environment values means that does actually nothing and just inherits an internal
/// store from ``AtomRoot`` as same as usual views, but ``AtomRelay`` provides the modifier
/// ``AtomRelay/observe(_:)`` to monitor all changes in atoms used in descendant views.
///
/// ```swift
/// AtomRelay {
///     MyView()
/// }
/// .observe(Logger())
/// ```
///
